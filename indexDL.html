Exercise-1:Hand written digit recognition with mnist
https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1m4wRQ3PAuxuVHAEOv9cT8Wt1z65i5xtc#scrollTo=8ynL5kEdqRg9
When we execute the program a file is generated 
The file is Recognizer.h5, we need another python file to test the input
Download the required files from
https://github.com/rsa914016/DL-Lab/tree/main/EX-01%20Hand%20Written%20Digits
After downloading run the file named Testing Interface.py using python
